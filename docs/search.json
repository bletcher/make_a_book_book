    "section": "2.2 Steps to set up the book",
    "text": "2.2 Steps to set up the book\n\n2.2.1 GitHub\n\n2.2.1.1 Create GitHub repo\nGo to your GitHub site and create a new repository (repo) for the book from the Repositories tab.\n\n\n\nNew repo\n\n\n\nUse a meaningful name for the book. This repo name will also be the name of your RStudio project (see below) and the default name for the github.io link (e.g. https://bletcher.github.io/make_a_book_book/).\nSet up your repo using the settings as in the image below (but using your own repo name and optional description):\n\n\n\nCreate a new repo\n\n\nHit Create repository to create the new repo.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Edit readme file\nEdit the readme file by hitting the pencil icon as shown below:\n\n\n\nEdit readme\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit readme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a short description about the repo (book). Hit Commit changes when done and return to the main repo page.\n\n\n2.2.1.3 Copy repo link\nCopy the repo link by hitting the green Code button (upper red arrow) and then the copy icon (lower red arrow). We will use this link to set up the project in RStudio.\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 RStudio\n\n2.2.2.1 Create project\nNow in RStudio, create a new project for your repo by clicking on New project in the upper right corner, then selecting Version control.\n\n\n\nCreate project\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Git and paste the copied repo link into Repository URL. This will automatically use your repo name as the project directory and the project name. Make sure to pick a subdirectory that makes sense for your file organization — I use a projects subdirectory for all my project.\nHit Create project to create the new project. This action copies the files from your GitHub repo into your computer’s project directory.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Copy base Quarto files\nThe make_a_book_book repository contains three files that will help us to start our book: _quarto.yml specifies Quarto options and sets up the structure of the book, index.qmd is the landing page for our (soon-to-be) github.io web page, and build_book.R file contains code for building the whole book or one chapter at a time (which will be useful as your book grows).\nDownload these files from the make_a_book_book repo’s GitHub page. You can get all three files (plus a bunch more) at once by hitting the green Code button, downloading a ZIP file, and extracting the files. Alternatively, you can download the files individually by clicking on each and hitting the download icon.\nAdd the files to your computer’s project folder. When you finish, RStudio should look like this:\n\n\n\nAdded files\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book: section of the _quarto.yml file, change the title and author to fit your project. Also, under the chapters: subheading, delete the main.qmd and links.qmd rows. These are chapters from the make_a_book_book project that you are reading that you will not use. As you add chapters (.qmd files) to your project, you will add rows for the corresponding Quarto file names.\nBe very careful to maintain proper spacing in the .yml file — check the Quarto documentation for .yml file details. The spacing should look like this:\n\n\n\nyml spacing\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Update .gitignore\nWe need to update the default .gitignore file that was created when we made the repo so that it does not ignore files in the \\doc subdirectory. This subdirectory is where the files for the web page will live.\nOpen the .gitignore file and comment out the docs/ line in the # pkgdown section so that it looks like this: #docs/.\nSave the file and close it. You should be able to pretty much ignore the .gitignore file from now on.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Create docs folder\nIn the Files section of RStudio, create a new subdirectory called docs. This will hold the documents for the github.io page.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.5 First commit\nSince we have made some changes to our files, now is a good time to do our first commit to GitHub. This will copy the selected files to GitHub and create the next version of the repo. Hit the Git tab and select all the files so that your project looks something like this:\n\n\n\nFirst commit\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Commit and add a meaningful message to the Commit message text box. Now, hit the Commit button and you should see a list of files that have changed. This has created a new version of all your commited files on your local computer. To send this commit to GitHub, hit the Close button and hit Push in the upper right hand corner of the RStudio: Review Changes box. Now hit the Close button on the Git Push box and close the RStudio: Review Changes. Repeat the commit/push procedure each time you have made significant changes to your project and you want to create a new version. The github.io web site will reflect the most recent version of your project in GitHub.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 github.io\nLet’s set up the github.io page so that anyone can see the contents of your project on the github.io web page.\nGo back to your GitHub page, open the Settings tab, and click on Pages. Select Deploy from a branch in the Source section and select the /docs option in the Select folder dropdown. Hit Save as shown below:\n\n\n\nSet up branch\n\n\n\nView in Full Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 RStudio 2\n\n2.2.4.1 Render the book\nOpen the build_book.R file, load the libraries and run quarto::quarto_render(output_format = \"html\"). This will build the book and place the files for the github.io site in the /docs folder.\nNow you should have files in the /docs folder. Redo the commit/Push sequence and we are ready to see the first version of our book on github.io.\n\n\n\n2.2.5 github.io 2\nReturn to your GitHub page and hit the Actions tab. If all went well, you should see a green check icon followed by “pages build and deployment”. If there is a green check and not a red x, we have created a web page. With larger books, it may take a while to update your page, so it can be helpful to check the Actions tab to track the build progress and confirm it is done before visiting your github.io page.\nNow that you have a working page, it’s a good idea to paste a link to it into your readme file. You can edit the readme file either in RStudio or directly in GitHub. If you edit within GitHub, make sure to Pull the project from RStudio in order to update the project on your local computer.",
